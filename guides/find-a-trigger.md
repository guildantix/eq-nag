## Finding a Trigger

After a while, there can be a lot of triggers and finding a specific trigger can be rather daunting even with everything organized into folders.  We can use the Search function on the Triggers tab to find a specific trigger.

The search function uses fuzzy search logic and looks at many properties of the trigger, including by order of importance:
1. Trigger Name
2. Trigger Capture Phrase (the log text used to execute a trigger)
3. Description

Start by navigating to the triggers tab.

Then enter your search text into the Search textbox at the top of the Triggers tab.

As you can clearly see in each example, multiple triggers appear for each query, but the trigger we're looking for is on top.
