You can enable or disable listening for quick shares in the settings tab.

## Sharing your triggers

To share your triggers, you can right-click on a trigger folder and choose "Quick Share"

This will bring up the quick share dialog.  Here you can add/remove any additional triggers and or trigger folders.

Once you have made your selections, click on the "Copy to Clipboard" button.  This will put the quickshare link in your clipboard.

You can send this to anyone running Nag in any public or private channel.

## Receiving a Quick Share

Once a quick share has been parsed and downloaded, you'll be able to select which folders and/or triggers you would like to have installed.

### Staging

When staging quick share triggers, all *new* triggers will be installed in a root folder named "Quick Share Staged".

**NOTE** *If the author of the quick share sends the same trigger (for example: they fixed an audio trigger), that trigger will be updated and will not be duplicated.  Updated triggers will be denoted with the orange cloud icon demonstrated in the screenshot.*

## Deleting Trigger Folders

This function has changed.  Originally, triggers that are contained in the hierarchy of the deleted folder would be orphaned but still remain.  Now, all triggers in the hierarchy will be deleted.
