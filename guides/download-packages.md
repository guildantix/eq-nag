On the left, you'll find the available trigger packages.

*This will change relatively soon(ish) to include categories and search features.*

Select the desired package on the left to view the details of the package.

The top of the package details will show the package name, a quick description of the package, and then begin listing out all of the triggers in the package.

If you want to know more about a specific trigger, hover over the note icon.

At the bottom, often "below the fold", you'll find the green **\[Install Package\]** button and the package update history.
