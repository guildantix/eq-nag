## Download

The current release version is v0.0.41 and you can find the details [here](https://github.com/guildantix/eq-nag/releases/tag/v0.0.41).

There are two ways to run Nag, via the installer or the portable.  The installer will automatically check for updates when Nag loads.

Download the [installer](https://github.com/guildantix/eq-nag/releases/download/v0.0.41/Antix-Parse-Setup-0.0.41.exe).

Download the [portable](https://github.com/guildantix/eq-nag/releases/download/v0.0.41/antixparse_portable.exe).

## Road Map

### Currently in Development

- [X] Fix an ongoing issue when arraigning all overlays that prevents the user from saving their changes.
- [ ] Creating a self-signed installation certificate.
- [ ] Adding more organization options to the trigger library.
- [ ] Quickshare to allow users to quickly share their triggers or installed packages with another player.

### On the Horizon
- [ ] Adding categories and search features to the package manager. Additionally, segregating installed packages from available packages.
- [ ] Changing the overlay subsystem to render all overlays in the same window.  This may improve performance.
- [ ] Adding healing done and healing received to the floating combat text.
- [ ] Overhaul the display engine for floating combat text to enable better animation styles and triggers.

### Odds and Ends
- [ ] Sortable trigger folders.
- [ ] Default trigger folder sort (None, Alpha, Reverse Alpha)

*Odds and ends can be done at any time*
