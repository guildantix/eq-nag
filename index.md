## Road Map

### Currently in Development

- [ ] Creating a self-signed installation certificate.
- [ ] Adding more organization options to the trigger library.
- [ ] Quickshare to allow users to quickly share their triggers or installed packages with another player.

### On the Horizon
- [ ] Adding categories and search features to the package manager. Additionally, segregating installed packages from available packages.
- [ ] Adding healing done and healing received to the floating combat text.
- [ ] Adding more options to the buff timer wizard.

### Odds and Ends
- [ ] Sortable trigger folders.
- [ ] Default trigger folder sort (None, Alpha, Reverse Alpha)

*Odds and ends can be done at any time*
